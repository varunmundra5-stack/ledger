"""ACPAgent — an AgentBase subclass that delegates to an ACP server.

The Agent Client Protocol (ACP) lets OpenHands power conversations using
ACP-compatible servers (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.) instead of direct
LLM calls.  The ACP server manages its own LLM, tools, and execution;
the ACPAgent relays user messages and collects the response. OpenHands
can still append prompt-only context, such as a skill catalog, to the
user message before it is sent to the ACP server.

Unlike the built-in Agent, one ACP ``step()`` maps to one complete remote
assistant turn. ACPAgent therefore emits a terminal ``FinishAction`` at the
end of each step to delimit that completed turn for downstream consumers.

See https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/overview

class _OpenHandsACPBridge:
    """Bridge between OpenHands and ACP that accumulates session updates.

    Implements the ``Client`` protocol from ``agent_client_protocol``.

    Concurrency model — ``on_event`` / ``on_token`` / ``on_activity`` are
    fired synchronously from ``session_update``, which runs on the
    ``AsyncExecutor`` portal thread.  The guarantees that keep callbacks
    serialized within a single turn rely on the combination of two things,
    not the GIL alone:

    1. ``LocalConversation.run()`` calls ``agent.step(...)`` while holding
       the reentrant ``ConversationState`` lock (a ``FIFOLock``) — see
       ``local_conversation.py`` where ``self.agent.step(...)`` sits inside
       ``with self._state:``.  The caller thread owns that lock for the
       entire duration of ``step()``, so no other thread can append to
       ``state.events`` during the turn.
    2. ``portal.call(_prompt)`` blocks the caller thread until ``prompt()``
       returns.  Live ``on_event`` calls happen on the portal thread while
       the caller thread is parked inside ``portal.call()`` still owning
       the state lock; the final ``MessageEvent`` / ``FinishAction`` run
       on the caller thread after ``prompt()`` returns.  The two phases
       never overlap in time.

    The caller's state-lock ownership is what excludes *other* threads
    (hook workers, remote-conversation push layers, visualizers spawned
    elsewhere) from racing with either phase.  The ordering between the
    two phases is what keeps a single consumer's cross-callback state
    (e.g. hook processors that read-then-write) consistent.

    Two invariants callers rely on:

    * ``on_event`` handlers MUST NOT acquire the conversation state lock
      (``with conversation.state:``).  The bridge fires them on the portal
      thread while the caller thread is parked inside ``portal.call()``
      owning that lock, and ``FIFOLock`` is thread-bound — a lock-acquire
      on the portal thread would deadlock rather than re-enter.
    * Tool-call → final-message ordering depends on the ACP server
      draining every ``session_update`` notification for a turn *before*
      the prompt response returns.  Verified against
      ``claude-agent-acp@0.29.0``; servers that interleave trailing
      ``ToolCallProgress`` after the prompt response would invert the
      order a consumer sees, and dedupe-by-id+"last-seen wins" would
      treat the post-message event as authoritative.

        Schedules the ACP ``conn.prompt`` round-trip on the portal loop
        (where ``self._conn`` lives) via ``BlockingPortal.start_task_soon``
        and awaits the result back on the caller's loop via
        ``asyncio.wrap_future``.  Post-prompt work — ``_record_usage``
        (and the ``stats_callback`` it triggers), ``on_event(action)``,
        ``on_event(observation)``, ``state.execution_status`` — runs
        entirely on the caller's thread.

        Why this matters: ``LocalConversation.arun`` holds the
        conversation state's reentrant ``FIFOLock`` on its loop thread
        across ``await self.agent.astep(...)``.  The default
        ``AgentBase.astep`` would wrap sync ``step`` in
        ``loop.run_in_executor(None, self.step, ...)``, moving every
        post-prompt callback to a worker thread.  Any ``with state:``
        inside that chain (today: ``stats_callback``; tomorrow: any
        callback added to LLM telemetry or the event pipeline) then
        blocks on a lock owned by the loop thread that is itself
        ``await``-ing ``astep`` to return.  Keeping post-prompt work on
        the caller's thread sidesteps the whole class of cross-thread
        state-lock deadlocks.  See #3348 / #3350 for the full diagnosis.

        Bridge ``session_update`` notifications continue to fire on the
        portal thread (no marshalling here) — they reach the user's
        ``on_event`` chain via the agent-server's
        ``_emit_event_from_thread`` queue, which already handles the
        thread hop.  Real-time mid-turn delivery of those events is a
        separate concern (the queue waits for ``arun()`` to release the
        state lock between iterations); it is not part of the deadlock
        this fix removes.

        """Switch the model on the running ACP session (mid-conversation).

        Issues a protocol-level ``session/set_model`` call on the live
        connection so the new model takes effect for subsequent turns in the
        *same* session — no subprocess restart, no loss of conversation
        context. Verified against claude-agent-acp and codex-acp.

        This is the low-level agent primitive; prefer
        :meth:`LocalConversation.switch_acp_model` as the entry point. That
        wrapper (a) holds the state lock so the switch cannot race a running
        ``step()``, and (b) persists the new value by swapping in an agent
        ``model_copy`` — ``acp_model`` is frozen, so this method updates only
        the live session and the sentinel ``llm.model``/metrics, **not**
        ``self.acp_model``. A direct caller therefore leaves ``acp_model``
        (which ``_record_usage`` reads for cost attribution) stale and the
        switch unpersisted; go through ``switch_acp_model`` instead.

        Args:
            model: Provider-specific model id to switch to (e.g.
                ``"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"`` or ``"gpt-5.4/low"``).

        Raises:
            ValueError: If ``model`` is empty or whitespace-only, if the
                detected provider does not support runtime model switching, or
                if the ACP server rejects the ``session/set_model`` call (e.g.
                method-not-found on a custom server, or an invalid model id).
            RuntimeError: If the ACP session has not been initialized yet
                (i.e. before the first ``run()``).
            TimeoutError: If the server does not answer within
                ``acp_prompt_timeout`` seconds.

        Note:
            A timeout means the client stopped waiting, not that the switch was
            rejected: the ``session/set_model`` request may already have been
            written and could still be applied server-side. The connection and
            session stay alive and the local sentinel model is intentionally
            left unchanged, so a timed-out switch leaves the server-side model
            indeterminate. The conservative choice (treat it as failed locally)
            keeps cost/token accounting on the previously-known model and
            self-heals on the next successful switch; the agent itself always
            runs whatever model the live ACP session holds.
